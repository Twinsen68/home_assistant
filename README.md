Custom Home Assistant Config

My Home Assistant Installation is pretty in-depth and I've gotton some questions about it, so I thought I'd post the main files here. Hope it helps some other folks.

The main customizations involve aquarium timers sincing with weather and tide data, and api links to a reef-pi build.
